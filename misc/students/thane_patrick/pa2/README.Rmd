# Setup and configuration
```{r setup}
library(languageR)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, load-dataframes}
beginningReaders = beginningReaders
english = english
spanishFunctionWords = spanishFunctionWords
danish = danish
dativeSimplified = dativeSimplified
```

# Scatterplots
Note: This data needs to be tidied, but my understanding is that this is sufficient for this assignment.
```{r, Reading_Data}
beginningReaders %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = LogRT, y = LogFrequency)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Log-transformed reaction time in milliseconds for each trial", y = "log-transformed frequency of lexical item", title = "Reading latencies by frequency of lexical items")
```

# Boxplot
Note: I must confess that I found the "sex" variable to be one that allowed me to complete the task in a relatively coherent way, although it pained me to make this type of distinctionâ€¦
```{r, Danish-boxplot}
danish %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Affix, y = LogRT, color = Sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Danish suffix in online task", y = "Average reaction times (log-transformed in milliseconds)", title = "Average reaction time by suffix")
```

# Stat summary and facets
```{r, stat-summary}
english %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = LengthInLetters, y = RTlexdec, color = WordCategory)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(AgeSubject)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean,
               geom = 'pointrange', size = 1, 
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 8, 1)) +
  labs(x = "Word length in letters", y = "Average RT (log-transformed in milliseconds) of lexical decision", color = "Word class", title = "Average lexical decision latencies by word length per group")
```
