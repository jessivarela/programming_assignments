Summary of Wickham (2015)

Week 1 

Wickham introduces the idea of practicing safe statistics by students, rather than abstaining for them altogether. This can be done by providing tools to students that are "safe". That is, those that are constrained but useful and applicable to 95% of problems. The tools would also be constrained, which limits potential beginners' mistakes. This way, statistics may be seen as a helpful tool, rather than a stigmatized aspect of beginning research.
